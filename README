Simple overlay for 32bit mesa drivers including llvmpipe

The overlay provides stripped x86 compatibility ebuilds to prevent collision problems

Switched back to using a non-live libX11 - we've not needed the live version for a while now

Added libxcb-32bit to work around some issues compiling any software requiring -lGL e.g. wine and mesa-progs-32bit
